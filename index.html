              Cristiano Ronaldo guided nine-man Al-Nassr to their first ever
              Arab Club Champions Cup title after scoring twice in a 2-1
              extra-time win over fellow Saudi side Al-Hilal on Saturday at the
              King Fahd Stadium.

              Ronaldo failed to land a trophy last season after his move to
              Al-Nassr, who finished runners-up in the Saudi Pro League, but the
              38-year-old scored six times in the tournament to finish as its
              top scorer en route to the title.
            </p>
            <p>
              The star-studded Al-Nassr side had many chances to score in the
              first half with new close season signings Sadio Mane, Seko Fofana
              and Marcelo Brozovic all denied by goalkeeper Mohammed Alowais.

              Ethan Hunt and his IMF team embark on their most dangerous mission
              yet: To track down a terrifying new weapon that threatens all of
              humanity before it falls into the wrong hands. With control of the
              future and the world’s fate at stake and dark forces from Ethan’s

              by a mysterious, all-powerful enemy, Ethan must consider that
              nothing can matter more than his mission – not even the lives of
              those he cares about most.

              In May an anonymous memo apparently written by a Google researcher
              concerned about the company’s future leaked online. It argued
              that, while executives squabbled about the competitive threat of
              text-generation technology from OpenAI, open source software was
              “quietly eating our lunch.”
            </p>
            <p>
              As proof, the memo cited Llama, a large language model made by
              Meta that was initially available only to researchers by
              invitation but within days leaked on 4Chan, and quickly became
              popular with programmers who adapted and built on the project.
              Within weeks of its release, variants called Alpaca and Vicuna
              were nearly as good as ChatGPT but agile enough to customize on a
              laptop computer. “The impact on the community cannot be
              overstated,” the leaked Google memo said. “Suddenly anyone is able
              to experiment.” ....
